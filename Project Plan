# Final Year Project Plan

## Project Title
LMS-Global 

## Brief Description
LMS-Global is an application designed to support local football enthusiasts in organizing and managing 'Last Man Standing' competitions. These events, commonly hosted by sports clubs as fundraisers, often pose significant logistical challenges for organizers. Tasks such as tracking participant registrations and payments, monitoring team selections and enforcing rules regarding previously chosen teams, handling buy-ins, and keeping up-to-date with football fixtures can become overwhelming. Additionally, organizers must manage notifications about eliminations and progress, further adding to the workload.

LMS-Global streamlines and automates the entire competition workflow. The application enables easy participant registration, payment tracking, and team selection management while ensuring rules are enforced automatically. It stays current with football fixtures and results, updating participant statuses accordingly. Automated SMS notifications keep players informed about available teams, competition progress, eliminations, and other important updates. By reducing manual effort and minimizing errors, LMS-Global allows organizers to focus on fostering community engagement and raising funds, while providing participants with a seamless and enjoyable experience.

A unique selling point of LMS-Global is its primary integration with WhatsApp, allowing participants to interact with the competition seamlessly through messages—making picks, receiving notifications, and staying updated without the need to download or learn a new app. For users who prefer a more detailed interface or want to explore additional features, LMS-Global also provides a web-based frontend where they can log in, view competition progress, access detailed information, and manage their participation with ease. This dual approach ensures accessibility and convenience for all users, catering to both casual participants and those seeking a deeper experience.

## Objectives
Develop a WhatsApp-integrated system for managing participant registration, team selections, and automated notifications.
Create a complementary web frontend for users and organizers to access competition details, historical data, and administrative tools.
Automate the tracking of football fixtures, competition progress, eliminations, and buy-ins to minimize manual workload and errors for organizers.

## Risks / Challenges
WhatsApp Integration Limitations: Restrictions or changes to WhatsApp’s API or policies could impact the bot’s functionality.
Data Privacy & Security: Handling personal data (such as phone numbers and payment information) requires compliance with privacy regulations and secure practices.
Fixture Updates: Ensuring timely and accurate updates of football fixtures and results from reliable sources.
User Adoption: Encouraging traditional organizers and participants to switch from manual methods to the digital system.
System Reliability: Ensuring the app works consistently during peak usage periods, such as just before pick deadlines.
Payment Processing: Integrating and maintaining secure payment options for buy-ins and tracking who has paid.
Handling Edge Cases: Managing special scenarios, such as team withdrawals, tie-breakers, or late joiners.
